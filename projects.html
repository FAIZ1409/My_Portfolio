                <h3>Odd or Even Game</h3>
                <p>
                    The Odd or Even game is a simple cricket-inspired Java game where a user plays against the computer. The user chooses "Odd" or "Even" and decides to bat or bowl. Both the user and computer pick numbers (1-10), and the sum determines the outcome. If the numbers match, the current player is out. The player with the highest runs wins.
